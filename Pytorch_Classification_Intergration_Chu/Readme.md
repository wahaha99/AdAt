# Some Classification Intergration
- Data (total 1770 images)
    - label 0 (healthy): 574
    - label 1 (cancer1): 403 
    - label 2 (cancer2): 793
    suggestionï¼šDivide the data set into training set, validation set, and test set. When extracting validation set and test set, they should be randomly selected in proportion to ensure that the three types of data are    proportionally distributed to training set, validation set and test set
